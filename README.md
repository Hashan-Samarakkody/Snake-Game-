    In level 2, also avoid collisions with the center wall.

5) How to Run:

    1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, Visual C++).
    2. Compile the source code and run the executable.
    3. To run the code you may need to use the following command :-
        g++ snake_game.cpp -o snake_game.exe
        ./snake_game.exe
    4. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the color theme and difficulty level.


6) Color Themes:

    Aqua: Bright cyan-based theme.
