    This is a simple console-based Snake Game written in C++. It offers a classic Snake gaming experience with additional features, including multiple difficulty levels and the ability to advance to the second level by reaching a certain score.

2) Features:

    1. Four color themes to choose from: Aqua, Yellow, White, and Purple.
    2. Three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
    3. Two game levels, with different challenges in level 2.
    4. Pause and resume gameplay with the spacebar.
    5. Display of the player's score.
    6. An option to exit the game.
    7. Colorful user interface.
    
3) Instructions

  3.1) Controls:
  
      W: Move the snake upwards.
      S: Move the snake downwards.
      A: Move the snake leftwards.
      D: Move the snake rightwards.
      Space: Pause the game.
      X: Quit the game.
  
  3.2) Gameplay:
  
      Collect all food items to increase your score.
      Avoid collisions with the snake's own body.
      In level 2, also avoid collisions with the center wall.
  
  3.3) How to Run:
  
      1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, Visual C++).
      2. Compile the source code and run the executable.
      3. To run the code you may need to use the following command:-
            g++ snake_game.cpp -o snake_game.exe
            ./snake_game.exe
      4. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the color theme and difficulty level.

4) Color Themes:

    Aqua: Bright cyan-based theme.
    Yellow: Vibrant yellow theme.
    White: Classic white theme.
    Purple: Stylish purple theme.
